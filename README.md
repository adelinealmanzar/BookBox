## Pitch:

Basic story of application:
    -This app will provide book reviews and allow users to write reviews
    -core features of MVP
User will be able to:
    -view the bookclub book of the month when the page initially loads
    -to click a previous bookclub book and see its details displayed on the page
    -leave a review
    -leave a numeric star rating
    -delete any review and edit rating
    -see an error message if the rating data they introduced is in incorrect format
    -(Stretch) filter book list
    -(Stretch) if user adds a review, they can remove or edit only that review
api data to use and how it will be used:
    -Db.json that we’re creating on the list of bookclub books up to a year back
challenges expecting to face:
    -Css formatting
    -Making the stars appear per star rating
    -Deleting user reviews
how we’re meeting recs of project:
    -html/css/js frontend that communicates to an api
    -single app
    -at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc)
    -interactivity (like button, adding comments); doesn’t need to persist after loading the page
    -good coding practices (no repeated code using fns)
